### Hey there!

I'm **Maur√≠cio Witter**, I am a software developer from Brazil, currently living in the city of Constantina. I love functional programming to create beautiful compositions that form declarative code. Additionally, I like contributing to open-source to create tools that help everyone.

My main knowledge in technologies are **Typescript**, **Node**, **Docker**, **React**, **Svelte**. I am also comfortable using **Vue**, **Golang** and **Java**. Nowadays, I am studying **Rust** and **Elixir**.

My main abilities include designing APIs, command-line interface, applying software testing methodologies, API modeling following software design principles, and refactoring code into nice abstractions.

Currently I have been studying Distributed Systems, concepts such as consensus, micro-services, pervasive computing, observability and open-telemetry.
